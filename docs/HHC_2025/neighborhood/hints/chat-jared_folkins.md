# Jared Folkins

Jared Folkins here! My favorite Christmas movie is White Christmas. You should find me on the socials and tell me what yours is.

You know, I think Santa is right! It truly is better to give than to receive.

I love singing Carols with my family! 🎵O holy night, the stars are brightly shining…🎵

Santa's got the right idea about giving, and I'm excited to give you a fantastic way to learn networking fundamentals!

This interactive visualization I've created shows you exactly how packets travel, how protocols work, and why networks behave the way they do.

It's way better than staring at boring textbooks - you can actually see what's happening!

Want to dive into some hands-on network exploration?

Wonderful! You've mastered those networking basics beautifully.

Now you can see how all the pieces of the network puzzle fit together - it's truly better to give knowledge than to keep it to yourself!
