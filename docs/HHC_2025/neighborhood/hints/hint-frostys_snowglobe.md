## A Code in the Dark, You Must Find

> From: Elder Gnome

The Elder Gnome said the route to the old secret lab inside the Data Center starts on the far East wing inside the building, and that the hallways leading to it are probably pitch dark. He also said the employees that used to work there left some kind of code outside the building as a reminder of the route. Perhaps you can search in the vicinity of the Data Center for this code.

## Backwards, You Should Look

> From: Elder Gnome

The Elder also recalled a story of another "computer person" like yourself who managed to find an intern that got lost inside the Data Center about 10 years ago. But that was before the reconstruction, so the current route likely isn't exactly the same. Maybe you can search for the Data Center's past in the historical archives that is the Internet for more information that may be helpful.
