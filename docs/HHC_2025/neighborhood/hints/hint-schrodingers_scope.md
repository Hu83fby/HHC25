## Hint 1 - Schrödinger's Scope

As you test this with a tool like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload), resist temptations and stay true to the instructed path.

## Hint 2

Though it might be more interesting to start off trying clever techniques and exploits, always start with the simple stuff first, such as reviewing HTML source code and basic SQLi.

## Hint 3

During any kind of penetration test, always be on the lookout for items which may be predictable from the available information, such as application endpoints. Things like a **sitemap** can be helpful, even if it is old or incomplete. Other predictable values to look for are things like token and cookie values

## Hint 4

Pay close attention to the instructions and be very wary of advice from the tongues of gnomes! Perhaps not ignore everything, but be careful!

## Hint 5

Watch out for tiny, pesky gnomes who may be **violating** your progess. If you find one, figure out how they are getting into things and consider **matching and replacing** them out of your way.
