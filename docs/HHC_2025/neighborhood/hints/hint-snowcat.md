## Snowcat 1

Snowcat is closely related to Tomcat. Maybe the recent Tomcat Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-24813) will work here.

## Snowcat 2

Maybe we can inject commands into the calls to the temperature, humidity, and pressure monitoring services.

## Snowcat 3

If you're feeling adventurous, maybe you can become root to figure out more about the attacker's plans.
