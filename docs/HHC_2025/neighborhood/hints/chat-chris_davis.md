Hi, my name is Chris.

I like miniature war gaming and painting minis.

I enjoy open source projects and amateur robotics.

Hiking and kayaking are my favorite IRL activies.

I love single player video games with great stoylines.

Swing by again soon. I may have a task that's perfect for you.

Hey, I could really use another set of eyes on this gnome takeover situation.

Their systems have multiple layers of protection now - database authentication, web application vulnerabilities, and more!

But every system has weaknesses if you know where to look.

If these gnomes freeze the whole neighborhood, forget about hiking or kayaking—everything will be one giant ice rink. And trust me, miniature war gaming is a lot less fun when your paint freezes solid.

Ready to help me turn one of these rebellious bots against its own kind?
