## Quantgnome Leap - hint 1

When you give a present, you often put a label on it to let someone know that the present is for them. Sometimes you even say who the present is from. The label is always put on the outside of the present so the public knows the present is for a specific person. SSH keys have something similar called a comment. SSH keys sometimes have a comment that can help determine who and where the key can be used.

User keys are like presents. The keys are kept in a hidden location until they need to be used. Hidden files in Linux always start with a dot. Since everything in Linux is a file, directories that start with a dot are also...hidden!

If you want to create SSH keys, you would use the ssh-keygen tool. We have a special tool that generates post-quantum cryptographic keys. The suffix is the same as ssh-keygen. It is only the first three letters that change.

## Quantgnome Leap - hint 4

Process information is very useful to determine where an application configuration file is located. I bet there is a secret located in that application directory, you just need the right user to read it!
