Hi, I'm Tom! I've worked for Counter Hack since its founding in 2010.

I love all things testing and QA, maintaining systems, logistics, and helping our customers have the best possible experience.

Outside of work, you'll find me at my local community theater producing shows, helping with sound or video, or just hanging around.

Well, I might have something developing. Come see me again soon, we'll see.

We've lost access to the neighborhood weather monitoring station.

There are a couple of vulnerabilities in the snowcat and weather monitoring services that we haven't gotten around to fixing.

Can you help me exploit the vulnerabilities and retrieve the other application's authorization key?

Enter the other application's authorization key into the badge.

If Frosty's plan works and everything freezes over, our customers won't be having the best possible experience—they'll be having the coldest possible experience! We need to stop this before the whole neighborhood becomes one giant freezer.
