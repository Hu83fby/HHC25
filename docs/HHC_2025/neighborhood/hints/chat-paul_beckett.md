Hey, I’m Paul!

I’ve been at Counter Hack since 2024 and loving every minute of it.

I’m a pentester who digs into web, API, and mobile apps, and I’m also a fan of Linux.

When I’m not hacking away, you can catch me enjoying board games, hiking, or paddle boarding!

Something's afoot, but the details aren't sorted. Do pop back - you'll want in on this.

As a pentester, I proper love a good privilege escalation challenge, and that's exactly what we've got here.

I've got access to a Gnome's Diagnostic Interface at gnome-48371.atnascorp with the creds ```gnome:SittingOnAShelf```, but it's just a low-privilege account.

The gnomes are getting some dodgy updates, and I need admin access to see what's actually going on.

Ready to help me find a way to bump up our access level, yeah?

Brilliant work on that privilege escalation! You've successfully gained admin access to the diagnostic interface.

Now we finally know what updates the gnomes have been receiving - proper good pentesting skills in action!
