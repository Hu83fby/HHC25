Hey, I'm Evan!

I like to build things.

All sorts of things.

If you aren't failing on some front, consider adjusting your difficulty settings.

Come find me later - I might need a hand with something.

So here's the deal - there are some seriously bizarre signals floating around this area.

Not your typical radio chatter or WiFi noise, but something... different.

I've been trying to make sense of the patterns, but it's like trying to build a robot hand out of a coffee maker - you need the right approach.

Think you can help me decode whatever weirdness is being transmitted out there?

You know what happens to electronics in extreme cold? They fail. All my builds, all my robots, all my weird coffee-maker contraptions—frozen solid. We can't let Frosty turn this place into a permanent deep freeze.
