Hello! I'm JJ. I like rock, metal, and punk music. That's all I have to say about that.

I accept BTC.

Skeletor is my hero!

Haven't got a thing for you just now, but do pop round later. I daresay I'll have something by then!

Alright then. Those bloody gnomes 'ave proper messed about with the neighborhood's wifi - changed the admin password, probably mucked up all the settings, the lot.

Now I can't get online and it's doing me 'ead in, innit?

We own this router, so we're just takin' back what's ours, yeah?

You reckon you can 'elp me 'ack past whatever chaos these little blighters left be'ind?

Brilliant work, that. Got me connection back and sent those gnomes packin' from the router.

Now I can finally get back to streamin' some proper metal. BTC tips accepted, by the way.
