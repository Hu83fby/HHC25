# [Gnome Tea](/docs/HHC_2025/neighborhood/modern_scandinavian_condo/gnome-tea.md)

## GnomeTea

I heard rumors that the new GnomeTea app is where all the Gnomes spill the tea on each other. It uses Firebase which means there is a client side config the app uses to connect to all the firebase services.

## Statically Coded

Hopefully they did not rely on hard-coded client-side controls to validate admin access once a user validly logs in. If so, it might be pretty easy to change some variable in the developer console to bypass these controls.

## License

Exif jpeg image data can often contain data like the latitude and longitude of where the picture was taken.

## Rules

Hopefully they setup their firestore and bucket security rules properly to prevent anyone from reading them easily with curl. There might be sensitive details leaked in messages.
