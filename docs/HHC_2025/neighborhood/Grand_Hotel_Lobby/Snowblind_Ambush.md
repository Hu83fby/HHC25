# Snowcat RCE & Priv Esc

## Objective

Difficulty: ❄️ ❄️ ❄️

Tom, in the hotel, found a wild Snowcat bug. Help him chase down the RCE! Recover and submit the API key not being used by snowcat.

## Hints

### Hint 1 - Snowcat

Maybe we can inject commands into the calls to the temperature, humidity, and pressure monitoring services.

### Hint 2 - Snowcat

If you're feeling adventurous, maybe you can become root to figure out more about the attacker's plans.

### Hint 3 - Snowcat

Snowcat is closely related to Tomcat. Maybe the recent Tomcat Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-24813) will work here.
