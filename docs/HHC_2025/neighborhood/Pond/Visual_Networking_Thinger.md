Santa's got the right idea about giving, and I'm excited to give you a fantastic way to learn networking fundamentals!

This interactive visualization I've created shows you exactly how packets travel, how protocols work, and why networks behave the way they do.

It's way better than staring at boring textbooks - you can actually see what's happening!

### Challenge 1: DNS Lookup

Step one is to find the IP address of visual-networking.holidayhackchallenge.com. Let's use an IPv4 DNS request!

### Challenge 2: TCP 3-Way Handshake

Now that we have the IP address of the web server, we need a TCP connection. Drag and drop TCP flags to create TCP 3-way handshake between client and server.

### Challenge 3: HTTP GET Request

Now that we have established a TCP connection, let's create an HTTP GET request to retrieve the web page.

### Challenge 4: TLS Handshake

Great job with HTTP! Now let's set up a secure connection using TLS. Drag and drop the TLS messages to create the correct handshake sequence.

### Challenge 5: HTTPS GET Request

Now that we've established a secure TLS connection, let's make an HTTPS request to retrieve the website securely.
